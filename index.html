        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;I'm the third son and fourth child in a family of seven, and I've grown up in the heart of Agege, Lagos State, Nigeria.
            From a young age, I've been fascinated by computers. I remember spending hours with my dad's old PC, trying to figure out how it workeda and then playing games.
            The endless possibilities of coding really captured my imagination. When I'm not buried in textbooks, you'll probably find me on the football pitch; 
            There's something about the rhythm of the game that just feels right. It's a great way to challenge myself and meeting new people.
            <br>            
            &nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a curious and passionate individual with a strong interest in science and technology. 
            I'm highly motivated with excellent research and analytical skills, an excellent communicator with the ability to work individually and as part of a team.
            I have always been fascinated by how things work and love to solve problems creatively. 
            I also take pleasure in modifying or adjusting electronics, disassembling and reassembling them, and constructing things from scratch.
            
            Growing up in a big family has taught me a lot about the importance of relationships.
            I'm really close to my siblings and parents, and I always try to be there for them when they need me. I also believe in helping others, whenever I can. 
            As for the future, I'm really excited about what lies ahead. I want to use my skills to make a positive impact on the world.
            And who knows? Maybe one day I'll be creating the next big technological breakthrough.
            So that's a little bit about me. If you want to know more, just ask!
