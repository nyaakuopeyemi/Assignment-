        <p>
            I'm a curious and passionate individual with a strong interest in science and technology. 
            I'm highly motivated with excellent research and analytical skills, an excellent communicator with the ability to work individually and as part of a team.
            I have always been fascinated by how things work and love to solve problems creatively. 
            I take pleasure in modifying or adjusting electronics, disassembling and reassembling them, and constructing things from scratch.

        <p>
            I'm drawn to AltSchool Africa's personalized learning and project-based approach.
            It allows me to tailor my education to my passion for coding while still ensuring a strong foundation in other subjects.
            This flexible curriculum is ideal for going deeper into the world of coding, something AltSchool has a proven track record of facilitating.

        <h2 id="engineering-goals"> Engineeering Aspirations</h2>
        <p>
            My ultimate goal is to futher pursue a degree in Front end engineering at AltSchool and use its skills to create innovative solutions for the future;
            With my first degree in Mechanical engineering, this would be and added advantage for me in terms of inovvation, 
            with my vision being spreed far more than my iniatial knowledge of just Mechanical entities.
